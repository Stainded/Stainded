# Stainded World [![](https://visitcount.itsvg.in/api?id=Stainded&icon=0&color=12)](https://visitcount.itsvg.in)

This is brief information about my world, this profile is redirected to post repositories that can help me or others as if it were an access center for restoration or enhancement and even rescue of abandoned code, here will be deposited eventually repositories of php, python, css3, nodejs, npm, mongodb, redis, apache-grovy, java, python, javascript, kotlin files and other more generalized things that might be useful to me or to those who wish to pass through here like you dear traveler.
