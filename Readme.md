# Stainded World [![](https://visitcount.itsvg.in/api?id=Stainded&icon=0&color=12)](https://visitcount.itsvg.in)

This is brief information about my world, this profile is redirected to post repositories that can help me or others as if it were an access center for restoration or enhancement and even rescue of abandoned code, here will be deposited eventually repositories of php, python, css3, nodejs, npm, mongodb, redis, apache-grovy, java, python, javascript, kotlin files and other more generalized things that might be useful to me or to those who wish to pass through here like you dear traveler.


## About me
I'm Stainded and I know my name might be funny but I'm a student of programming and a student of code improvement and my goal around here is to post great repositories and i'm currently living in South America and i like to socialize with people trying to give some kind of support as far as i can.


## Purpose Profile

Here are listed objectives that this profile will bring, of course it won't be possible to help everyone in a certain way but I will try to do my best if I can, i do not expect rewards, but that people can value my capacity for improvement and intellect.
